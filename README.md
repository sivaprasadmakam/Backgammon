## Gameplay

### Objective

The goal of Backgammon is to move all your checkers into your home board and then bear them off. The first player to bear off all their checkers wins the game.

### Game Rules

1. **Setup**: Each player starts with 15 checkers. The board has 24 points, divided into four quadrants.
2. **Rolling the Dice**: Players take turns rolling two dice. The numbers rolled dictate how many points a player can move their checkers.
3. **Hitting**: If you land on a point occupied by a single opponent's checker, you hit it and send it to the Bar.
4. **Re-entry**: A player must re-enter any checkers on the Bar before making other moves.
5. **Bearing Off**: Once all your checkers are in your home board, you can start bearing them off.

### Strategies

- **Control the Center**: Occupying the center points can provide strategic advantages.
- **Blotting**: Try to leave single checkers (blots) for your opponent to hit.
- **Timing**: Know when to hit and when to build your own points.
